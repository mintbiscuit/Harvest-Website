Harvest-Website
===============

This website was created for a non-profit group that I interned with in Spring 2013. Aside from maintaining their Access database, assisting with event planning and setup, and general IT work, I was given the opportunity to design a new website for the group. I consulted with the organization's leader and we worked through the process of the website desig, including his requirements and what he expected the overall design to look like. This is the final result, according to his preferences. The website is relatively simple - it utilizes only HTML and CSS to create an easy-to-navigate interface.

Although the code here only references one page (index.html), the entire website was implemented. (This is just to give a general overview of how the website was constructed).

The organization currently uses this website (http://harvestministryteams.com) and it is routinely updated by their web administrator.
